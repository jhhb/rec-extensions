;;; rec-extensions.el --- A set of extension for rec-mode

;;; Commentary:
;; I intend for this to eventually become a package of wrappers around the
;; GNU Recutils utilities and (possibly) the Emacs major mode.
;; It's probably more accurate to brand this as "rec-extensions" or similar
;; rather than "enh-rec-mode" since I'd like this to be useful additions
;; to GNU Recutils and rec-mode rather than a fork or replacement of
;; Recutils or rec-mode.

;; I use org-mode and org tables to log lots of arbitrary events +
;; data.  Rather than storing this data in org tables, I'd like a way
;; to easily define data types and insert them into a log file
;; somewhere.  I'd like inserting data with pre-defined types to be
;; the default, with the option to arbitrarily insert data.  It would
;; be amazing to be able to run a key-command, select a record type to
;; insert, and then have an interactive experience to fill in the data
;; for the selected record type, with highlighting for the field
;; metadata, telling me which fields are mandatory, the type of each
;; field, requirements for each field, if the field is auto-created or
;; not, etc.  I'd like to run something like C-c r and then go through
;; a set of menus to fill in my data.

;; I'd love to be able to support the following:

;; - Interaction with, exploration of, recfile schemas

;; - Easy creation of records with the ability to see the schema
;;   the record on insert.

;; - A centralized place for recfile storage

;; - Syncs between the the schemas declared in recfiles, and a master
;; schema, to power interactive features.

;; Necessarily, powering some of these features is most easily
;; accomplished with a very opinionated approach to managing and using recfiles.
